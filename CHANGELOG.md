# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- A third vitest project, `components` (`environment: "nuxt"` via `@nuxt/test-utils`, jsdom), renders
  `*.dom.test.ts` specs with `mountSuspended` against the playground app: keyboard, ARIA and emit
  behaviour of `field/Repeater.vue` and `BlockTree.vue`, the save path of `CollectionEditor.vue`
  (dirty keys only, success toast, 400 field error mapped onto the field) and `sanitizeInBrowser`
  (script, inline handlers, `javascript:` links and iframes removed; safe formatting kept).
- `#kestrel/pipelines` exports `definePipeline`, typed against `PresetStep`, so a misspelled step in
  a consumer's own `pipelines/index.ts` fails `nuxt typecheck`; `pipelineDefiner` is documented for
  consumers with modules of their own. `#kestrel/consumer-pipelines` and `#kestrel/consumer-modules`
  carry ambient types (`layers/core/types/consumer-entries.d.ts`).
- `featureOrder` and `staticPipelineNames` are runtime values of `#kestrel/pipelines`; invariant
  tests tie them to the `Feature` union, to the pipeline names `definePreset` generates and to the
  features table in `docs/consuming-kestrel-web.md`. The module registry is tested against the
  `@michaelthielemann/kestrel-*` dependencies in `package.json`.
- `layers/core/server/boot.test.ts` boots the playground config through the real `boot()` and
  `kestrel.run()` in CI: pipeline resolution, the login → `auth.loggedIn` → `auditAuth` chain, the
  upload limit and inline types derived from the booted registry, and a mistyped step failing boot
  with a `KestrelBootError`.
- Admin: UI step names are a typed union (`uiStepNames`, `defineUiStep`) with a registry test;
  `runAction` rethrows unexpected step errors in development and flags them `meta.unexpected` in
  production, where the editor, list and upload composables show a dedicated toast.
- Admin: a failed backend boot shows a full-page notice instead of the login page (`GET /api/ready`
  with `state: "failed"`); the server also prints a multi-line banner with module and reason.
- Public site: the block marker of the preview is keyboard-operable (`role="button"`, Enter and
  Space on the focused marker, visible focus ring).
- Tests for `sanitizeIconSvg`, the server-side HTML sanitizer, `collections.ts` and the block
  marker attributes.

### Changed

- `no-unsafe-type-assertion` applies wherever the other type-aware rules do (every layer,
  `packages/renderer-nuxt`, `playground`, `.vue` included, tests included); 199 assertions became
  discriminated-union guards (`fieldIs`), `boundaryCast` at real JSON, AST, DOM or host boundaries,
  generic overloads or small literal-union guards; nine directives remain for TypeScript and
  standard-library gaps, each with its reason.
- Admin: every `runAction` call site outside `pages/admin/system.vue` shows the unexpected-error
  toast on `meta.unexpected` (29 sites).
- `layers/core/nuxt.config.ts` enables `typescript.shim`, so `.vue` imports from `.ts` files need no
  component cast; the insights canvas virtual module carries an ambient declaration.
- vitest 4 (root and `packages/renderer-nuxt`; a stale nested vitest 3 had silently dropped the
  three renderer contract tests); jsdom is the DOM environment of the `components` project.
- Module-config lookups (upload limit, inline SVG types, readiness probe, images `publicPath`
  check) resolve the owning module through the booted `kestrel.steps.owner()` instead of calling
  each module's `steps()`; a module can no longer borrow another module's config by accident.
- Type-aware ESLint rules (`no-floating-promises`, `no-misused-promises`, `await-thenable`,
  `no-unsafe-*`, `require-await`, `restrict-template-expressions`,
  `no-unnecessary-type-assertion`) apply to every layer, `packages/renderer-nuxt` and `playground`,
  including `.vue` script blocks; `no-unsafe-type-assertion` is an error in
  `layers/admin/app/actions`. `playground/app/**` is covered by the backend-import ban.
- `featureOrder` derives from `featureFactories`; `StaticPipelineName` derives from
  `staticPipelineNames`.
- The type stubs for the optional `@vue-flow/core` and `@dagrejs/dagre` peers contain no `any`.

### Fixed

- `sanitizeInBrowser` throws instead of returning the unsanitized input when DOMPurify reports
  the environment as unsupported.
- `collections-serialize.ts`: a `relation` override applies only on top of an existing base
  relation instead of producing an incomplete `{ collection, many }` object.
- Media viewer: a failed metadata request no longer leaves an unhandled rejection; the dialog shows
  a translated inline error.
- Upload limit: a failed `GET /limits` no longer disables the size guard for the session; the
  check is retried and the error shown.
- Logout and session check: a failed `/logout` is logged and toasted; only a 401 from `/me` ends the
  session, any other failure keeps the token and shows a "backend not reachable" notice with a
  retry button on the login page.
- Dashboard tiles show a per-tile load error instead of a silent dash.
- `GET /api/ready` non-200 bodies carry `code` (mirrors `state`).
- Two no-op `boundaryCast` calls removed; `layers/core/types/schemas.d.ts` is an ambient
  declaration again (a trailing `export {}` had turned it into an augmentation that failed
  silently under type-aware linting).
- `docs/architecture.md`: the UI runner is described without the non-existent
  `PipelineFailure`/`PipelineDone` analogy, the actions runner import path and the `cast.ts`
  statement are correct; `docs/consuming-kestrel-web.md` links the backend pipeline docs instead of
  a missing `docs/PIPELINES.md`.
